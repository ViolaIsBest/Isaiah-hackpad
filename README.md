## Isaiah's Shortcutting Hackpad
My hackpad project to create a macropad for the Hack Club YWSW, and to learn about macropad / keyboard design! My hackpad uses 9 switches in a basic 3x3 configuration, as well as 2 LED lights, and the RP2040 microcontroller. I was starting from scratch for all but the CAD part of this project, so there was a big learning curve, but I've learned a lot about PCB design (schematics/layout) and also firmware through this project! My hackpad primarily functions for keyboard shortcuts for easy convenience, currently set with the volume buttons, control/shift, and the directional arrows.

# PCB
This took me a while to learn initially, but after I started getting the hang of the software I learned a lot!

# CAD
I already knew how to design in CAD, the only hard part for me on this part was figuring out the dimensions of the switches for the top part of the case.
